                      training. When I joined Karate, I was physically unfit and only had a white belt. Over the
                      years, I improved and eventually got to Purple Belt. The thing is, after Purple the
                      difficulty to achieve Blue became extremely hard. However, with hardwork I managed to
                      acheive it. Furthermore, I was even made the captain of my School karate team </span>
